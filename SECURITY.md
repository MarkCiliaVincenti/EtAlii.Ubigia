## Supported Versions

***REMARK: Ubigia is still very much a research project***

## Reporting a Vulnerability

- Where to go: Please reach out privately to the community leads when there is something seriously flawed which needs to be taken care of. 
- Updates to be expected on a reported vulnerability: As long as the Ubigia project does not have a official release no commitment can be made on how vulnerabilities will be handled.
- What to expect if the vulnerability is:
  - Accepted: Life long appreciation!
  - Declined: A fair argumentation.
